 # Home Automation Simulation

This project demonstrates a **Home Automation System** using the **Blynk IoT Application** and **Picsimlab**. The simulation is designed to automate household appliances, allowing users to control devices remotely via a smartphone. 

## Key Features:
- **Blynk IoT Application**: Enables remote control and real-time monitoring of appliances.
- **Picsimlab**: Simulates the microcontroller environment for home automation.
- **IoT Connectivity**: Uses MQTT protocol for data transfer between devices and the Blynk cloud.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive control panel in the Blynk app.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Embedded C/C++**: For microcontroller programming.
- **Blynk Cloud**: For IoT device management.
- **Picsimlab**: For simulating the microcontroller's hardware environment.

## How to Run:
1. Open the simulation project in **Picsimlab**.
2. Use the **Blynk IoT App** to control the simulated appliances.
3. The simulation is configured to work with the MQTT protocol for secure communication.

## Future Enhancements:
- Integration with real-world hardware components.
- Adding more automation rules and sensor-based controls.
